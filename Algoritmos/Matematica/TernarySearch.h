 * Description:
 * Find the smallest i in $[a,b]$ that maximizes $f(i)$, assuming that $f(a) < \dots < f(i) \ge \dots \ge f(b)$.
 * To reverse which of the sides allows non-strict inequalities, change the < marked with (A) to <=, and reverse 
 * the loop at (B).
 * To minimize $f$, change it to >, also at (B).
 * If you are dealing with real numbers, you'll need to pick $m_1 = (2a + b)/3.0$ and $m_2 = (a + 2b)/3.0$. 
 * Consider setting a constant number of iterations for the search, usually $[200,300]$ iterations are sufficient
 * for problems with error limit as $10^{-6}$.
 * Status: tested
 * Usage: int ind = ternSearch(0,n-1,[\&](int i){return a[i];});
 * Time: O(\log(b-a))
