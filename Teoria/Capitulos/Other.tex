\subsubsection{String Matching with Wildcards}


Consider a text $T$ and a pattern $P$. $P$ and $T$ may have wildcards that will match any character. The problem is to get the positions where $P$ occur in $T$.

If we define the value of the characters such that the wildcard is zero and the other characters are positive, there is a matching at position $i$ iff $\sum_{j=0}^{|P|-1}P[j]T[i+j](P[j] - T[i + j])^2 = 0$. Then, one can evaluate each term of 
$$ \sum_{j=0}^{|P|-1}(P[j]^3T[i+j] - 2P[j]^2T[i+j]^2 + P[j]T[i + j]^3) $$ 

using three convolutions.
